# HotelOsApps

**The application repository.** Every installable HotelOS application is
developed here — or in a repository shaped exactly like this one — as a
**separate application, by its own developer, without the platform's core
code**. It binds to HotelOS at exactly one point: the signed `.hopkg`
install.

Ruled by platform ADR 0122 and its same-day addendum (owner direction,
2026-08-28), building on ADR 0121 (an application carries its own
documentation) and ADR 0092 (the `.hopkg` package contract).

## What an application is

One directory per application, each **fully self-contained**:

```text
<app>/
  docs/
    chapters/      the application's design
    decisions/     the application's ADRs — numbered locally from 0001,
                   indexed in their own README.md
  backend/         .NET service per the platform template
  frontend/        the desktop module
  schemas/  migrations/  tests/  assets/
  manifest.yaml
```

## What an application may depend on

The platform's **contracts and SDK** — never its internals:

* `shared/protos` — the contract language
* `HotelOS.Platform` — the .NET SDK
* the manifest schema and package layout of **ADR 0092 (`.hopkg` v1)**
* a locally **installed HotelOS** as the development and test platform

How the protos and SDK are taken is an implementation choice for now — a
sibling-path reference to the platform checkout, or a copied `shared/protos`
— until an SDK-publishing round makes them proper artifacts (ADR 0122
addendum). What an app never does is build, modify or import the platform's
*services*: Kernel, Identity, Master Data, Context. If an app needs something
the contracts don't expose, that is a request to the platform team.

## The deliverable

A **signed `.hopkg`** per ADR 0092 — built from the app directory, signed at
the registry by the vendor (the signing key never enters any repository,
this one included), distributed through the hosted registry, installed by
Software Center. Git is how apps are *developed*; `.hopkg` is the only form
in which an application ever reaches a property.
