/**
 * The marks a value carries, and the four kinds the design keeps distinct.
 *
 * The gold frames use four visually different attachments and they mean
 * different things — which is why they are four functions here rather than one
 * styled string:
 *
 * ```text
 * mark   where a value came from        from Opera · override · disagrees
 * lock   how it was established         OBSERVED · FROM OPERA · DERIVED …
 * pill   a state of the thing           complete · same room · names look alike
 * link   an action inline in the value  reveal · ＋ assign · ＋ add
 * ```
 *
 * A `lock` is deliberately not a lock on editing — `FROM OPERA` says who
 * established the value, and staff may still write it. PMS-connected has never
 * meant read-only (GUEST-Q1, as amended).
